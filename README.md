# Carebox Test assignment
During this test assignment I've tried to replicate architecture we described on the call

I've tried several approaches during implementation:
 - Override UI via passing different templates (no data changes possible there)
 - Change look ad feel by simple CSS changes
 - Component inheritance (we can change templates and data for given component without any restriction)

Testing and error hadling I've been to able to implement in time (
  - really hard to find nowadays live covid API
  - a lot of time have been spent on investigation of the ways the tasks could be potentially done
)

Comments appreciated.
